                    <p>During your journey, especially at the beginning do your best to remove yourself from fear and
                        anxieties associated with your worship and relationship with God through Jesus The Christ, High
                        Priest and King of our world.</p>
                    <p><strong><u>References:</u></strong> John 4:23-24, and 1 Timothy 2:5 <br>John 4:23-24 NKJV - 23
                        But the hour is coming,
                        and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father
                        is seeking such to worship Him. 24 God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in
                        spirit and truth."<br>1 Timothy 2:5 NKJV - 5 For there is one God and one Mediator between God

                    <p>
                        Become love because God is love, therefore become as God is so that you may also be a daughter
                        and son of the Most High God. This is the initial path that leads to being a sibling and friend
                        of Jesus, sharing the same parent. Be patient and preservere as those who are evil will attack
                        the love which you have become, and unfortunately those who have killed their soul may even test
                        or entice you to madness, moving you away from the wonderful love of God. So hold on, and review
                        the fifth point regarding seperating yourself from those who are being evil towards you.

                    <h3 id="judgement-heading"><strong><u>3: Judgement:</u></strong></h3>
                    <p>
                        Unless you have been appointed the seat of a judge on earth concerning the Laws of earth's
                        societies, do not judge, avoid this trap at all cost unless if you seek judgement yourself from
                        the creator of all. There are sins that can be forgiven, but sin against the spirit of God
                        cannot be forgiven in this world or the next to come, so maintain the spirit which God put in
                        you to give you a wonderful life do not sell it for dirt. If judgement comes into your mind,
                        consider first where this is stemming from, if you must give yourself space from those who
                        attempt to encite you do so at your own personal discretion.

                        Jesus has two sides that make his face, the left side and the right side, both of them belong to
                        the same person and spirit. This will help when others try to limit your expression.

                    <p>Rarely are people condemned by Jesus.
                        <br>
                        <strong><u>Concerning Judgements:</u></strong> Avoid judgements that lead to exiling or
                        ex-communicating others, unless
                        if God should send you into exile. In this instance remember the parable of the prodigal son, if
                        someone is a true nuisance :) it is okay to take a break from them, but do it without
                        bitterness, if they are evil towards you, it is okay to seperate entirely and go a different
                        way, ensure this is also done without hate remaining in your heart, but protect your faith and
                        yourself.
                        <br>
                        <strong><u>Concerning Teachers:</u></strong> Your teacher: Jesus is the High priest and God's
                        chosen King of all creation, He is the final
                        authority, so be a disciple of Jesus and you will avoid the tensions that come from those who
                        wish to limit your liberty in Christ by enforcing the teachings of other apostles; Paul is not
                        bad and neither is John or peter but they are not the final authorities, Jesus is. Learn freely
                        from the apostles, especially from the hardships they had to endure in maintaining their faith
                        in a world that became cruel to those who believe Jesus, but ultimately be a student and friend
                        of Jesus above any other teachers.
                        <br>
                        <strong><u>Concerning Women:</u></strong> Fellow sisters: If any congregation tells you or
                        promotes that you cannot enherit Christ as an
                        elect, beware that leader in your congragetion is a wolf in sheeps clothing. In the Kingdom of
                        God, now and the one to come Women serve in the court of God tending to the most important
                        matters concerning the creation and protection of our Universe. You may have heard of angels who
                        are men (and other kinds of intelligent species), now know this, there are angels who are women
                        with more power and responsibilities greater than any priest, teacher or pastor anywhere on
                        Earth. On the earth, Women have served the Majesty of God as prophets, judges, and teachers
                        these women also make up the elect of God. When we enter our heavenly service before and after
                        the renewed earth is established, there will not be any kind of differentiating between man,
                        woman, slave or master, instead we will all be one face, one mind and one Christ.

                        lifted up the ephah between the earth and the heaven.

                    <p>
                        My friends, I write this because some of you can relate to my personal spiritual journey. Maybe
                        most of you, like myself keep your identity to yourself, I am an Ace and I definately keep my
                        identity to myself as it is often confusing for others; but this is the beauty of God, come to
                        Jesus as you are. If you truly love Jesus, as I do, and for you it may be even more intimate and
                        personal, and if you seek to know the beaty of God start with patience... lots of it, and know
                        that Jesus does not condemn you but seeks for the hearts of people to move away from the evil
                        which destroys the earth. Sexuality and identity are personal matters and so is your
                        relationship with Jesus. Forget those that have hurt you and seek the love and kindness from God
                        which Jesus gives freely. You do not have to pursue the call of a teacher, priest or even the
                        144,000, instead seek to enter God's new heaven and earth as a citizen through the kindness and
                        love which comes free from Jesus. Hold to YOUR FAITH, hold on dearly and pray for endurance,
                        once the book of life which is already written in heaven closes you too will witness the
                        wonderful face of God and roam His nation as a citizen with equal rights; more than that, you
                        will be assigned a tribe and not be called a foreigner but an equal citizen of God's Earth and
                        Heaven. You will see Jesus, eat with him, and dance in the Universe's greatest after-party, yes
                        you will celebrate and celebrate. Jesus is yours!

                        references, instead

                        <strong>verse</strong><br>
                        John 8:1-12 New International Version (NIV)

                        but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. At dawn he appeared again in the temple courts, where all
                        the people gathered around him, and he sat down to teach them. The teachers of the law and the
                        Pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery. They made her stand before the group and said
                        to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. In the Law Moses commanded us
                        to stone such women. Now what do you say?” They were using this question as a trap, in order to
                        have a basis for accusing him. But Jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his
                        finger. When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of
                        you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.” Again he stooped down and wrote on
                        the ground. At this, those who heard began to go away one at a time, the older ones first, until
                        only Jesus was left, with the woman still standing there. Jesus straightened up and asked her,
                        “Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?” “No one, sir,” she said. “Then neither do I
                        condemn you,” Jesus declared. “Go now and leave your life of sin.” When Jesus spoke again to the
                        people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness,

                    <p>
                        Families are the fundamental building of blocks of the Universe; the family architecture is so
                        essential that even new born has the story of a mother and a father. You have two families, your
                        spiritual family and physical family on earth. Love God by also loving those who are your
                        mothers, fathers, siblings and grandparents, love your family and love those whom they love. by
                        doing so you will have a large spiritual family that includes those whom you are born with and
                        those that God gives to you as a spiritual family. The union of God play a great role in the
                        Universe and in your personal life, if one does not have parents see to it that you know God is
                        your Father and Mother, and Jesus is your brother and friend. Regarding marriage, as Jesus
                        points out in Matthew, marriage is not a requirment but only a personal choice, neither is it a
                        requirement to win God's favor. Love your families, and love your neighbors.

                        Matthew 22:37-40 (KJV)

                        37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy
                        soul, and with all thy mind.

                        38 This is the first and great commandment.

                        39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

                        40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

                        When two people come together and unify themselves in love and seek to start a family together, by God, these two have been married. There is no need for any specific ceremonies or contracts, as these are traditions that developed over time. <strong>Genesis 2:24. ESV Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh.</strong>
                        <br> marriage ceremonies, are not bad: actually they are good, as other invited families and friends can come to witness a man and a woman coming together, and commiting love to one another. But not everyone can afford these ceremonies and the cost of contracts, so coming together as the bible describes, is usually the most feesable and more intimate way of bonding and becoming one flesh, a united being. a husband and a wife are titles for those that have chosen to bond with each other in the manner of becoming one, and their gift if they choose, are children. <strong>Genesis 1: [27] So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them.
                            [28] And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</strong>, another verse <strong>Psalm 127: 3 Behold, children are a heritage from the Lord,
                                The fruit of the womb is a reward.</strong>
                                <br>
                        So in the Spirit of God, come together, and build a home together; rejoice with the gifts, and the bond you have. Her troubles, and His troubles are yours together, be strong, and do not let the adversary The devil come in between. Be good and understanding with each other, and as the apostles have written, do not tempt your children to be upset with anger or frustrations from treatment, instead treat each other and your children with love and compassion. Take good care of your gifts.
                        <br><br>
                        <h4>Marriage and bearing children is not a call for everyone:</h4>
                        Again I write nothing new, for some man and women, coming to Christ and the Kingdom of God as they are is sufficient. This might just be the majority, if this is also their choice, do not be a stumbling block, their heritage is Jesus, The Christ of God.
