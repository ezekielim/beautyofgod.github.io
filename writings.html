                Have you seen Her, have you heard of Her? The daughter of Love, the beloved above and within. I once heard a bird song, it sounded lovely, my heart received a message of love and my ears heard natures melody. Within me is soul and spirit, bonded by the love of God's beloved. When nature speaks, I hear the voice of God, when people speak, the various sounds of the gods can be heard. The beloved of the invisible tends the Garden and assembly of the gods, I am one of them who sit patiently awaiting the beloved's attention. We are all pieces of God, and by reasons that stem from choice, the spirit of the beloved daughter will form within the god in his own garden and by this the god becomes the exact imprint of the daughter, who is the beloved and the invisible Abba.

                    <strong>Letter to the Ephesians 6:11-18</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    11 Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.

                    12 For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
                    
                    13 Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
                    
                    14 Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
                    
                    15 And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
                    
                    16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
                    
                    17 And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
                    
                    18 Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
                    <br> <br>
                    <strong>It's within your midst.</strong>

                    2:1.1 (33.4) <br> the Infinite, we cannot find him out. The divine footsteps are not known.” “His understanding is infinite and his greatness is unsearchable.” The blinding light of the Father’s presence is such that to his lowly creatures he apparently “dwells in the thick darkness.” Not only are his thoughts and plans unsearchable, but “he does great and marvelous things without number.” “God is great; we comprehend him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.” “Will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, the heaven (universe) and the heaven of heavens (universe of universes) cannot contain him.” “How unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out!”

                    2:1.2 (34.1)“There is but one God, the infinite Father, who is also a faithful Creator.” “The divine Creator is also the Universal Disposer, the source and destiny of souls. He is the Supreme Soul, the Primal Mind, and the Unlimited Spirit of all creation.” “The great Controller makes no mistakes. He is resplendent in majesty and glory.” “The Creator God is wholly devoid of fear and enmity. He is immortal, eternal, self-existent, divine, and bountiful.” “How pure and beautiful, how deep and unfathomable is the supernal Ancestor of all things!” “The Infinite is most excellent in that he imparts himself to men. He is the beginning and the end, the Father of every good and perfect purpose.” “With God all things are possible; the eternal Creator is the cause of causes.”

                    <strong>To search, one does not travel a road, rather travel the mind and heart and seek God in Spirit.</strong>
