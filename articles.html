                Have you seen Her, have you heard of Her? The daughter of Love, the beloved above and within. I once heard a bird song, it sounded lovely, my heart received a message of love and my ears heard natures melody. Within me is soul and spirit, bonded by the love of God's beloved. When nature speaks, I hear the voice of God, when people speak, the various sounds of the gods can be heard. The beloved of the invisible tends the Garden and assembly of the gods, I am one of them who sit patiently awaiting the beloved's attention. We are all pieces of God, and by reasons that stem from choice, the spirit of the beloved daughter will form within the god in his own garden and by this the god becomes the exact imprint of the daughter, who is the beloved and the invisible Abba.
